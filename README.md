# Project Requirements:

1. At least five models.  You do not have to have all of these built
out on day one.  Just having three is fine.  But by Monday, you should
have five models.

2. Some methods in your models.  Each group member should write at
least 4 -5 methods. So there should be at least twenty methods total
in your models.

3. Adapter Pattern in Rails

4. Specs - there should be at least 20 specs in your project (five per person).

5. An analytics page - I will show some charting libraries for this in
a lecture - so don't worry about displaying this data visually.  The
main learning goal of this is to get you to write some interesting
activerecord queries.  I will also try to have a review of advanced AR
some time this week.

6. No APIs until you get approval from an instructor.  The reason we
hold off on APIs is because API's oftentimes leads you to learning the
API really well, but not learning rails that well.  Rails is a more
transferable skill.  So stick with that.

-- When you have an api, use HTTParty (or some similar library), and
not a gem (just like last time)
